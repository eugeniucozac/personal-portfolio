# Personal Portfolio

This is a profesional portfolio for a developer or a designer

## Quick Overview

In this project I used NodeJS, ExpressJS with EJS template and MongoDB.

To install the project you should:

```
npm install
```

* Also you must create a js file: passwords_local.js and put all your credentials there or to have a heroku account for Production.
* MongoDB url and to PORT will be by default.
* And you need to have a Cloudinary account for uploading images.


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
